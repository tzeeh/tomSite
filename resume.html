        <b>SUMMARY</b>
      </span>
    </h4>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">I am seeking a job that offers both a friendly work environment and advancement opportunities. I truly enjoy programming
      and honing my skills in the field, so I am well equipped for a position that rewards commitment and passion. As a testament
      to these qualities, I’ve earned my associate’s degree in Web and Software development from Western Technical College
      in La Crosse, WI and developed experience as a programmer for Cabela’s in Prairie du Chien, WI. I now hope to continue
      my personal and professional development by exploring jobs in larger cities that offer greater opportunities. Please
      visit my personal website and blog to read about more of my interests and skills. </span>

      <b>Developer I, Cabelas Inc.</b>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prairie Du Chien, WI — Current</span>
    </h5>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Started as a Reporting Specialist I , but after just a few months, my managers recognized my hard work by promoting me
      to Reporting Specialist III and then Developer I. My primary job expectation was to create and edit web pages for all
      Cabelas distribution centers in the United States and Canada. To do so, I use HTML, PHP, CSS, Javascript, Oracle Databases,
      SQL, and Angular, among other specialized web-based tools when necessary. In addition to fully meeting my job expectations,
      my goal is to become a full stack programmer allowing me to work both on the back and front side of web pages. I work
      in a single office with about 10 other people where I develop new websites or manipulate old ones. I have never found
      it hard to get along with the people that I work with.</span>
