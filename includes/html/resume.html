    <b>SUMMARY</b>
  </span>
</h4>
<p> I am seeking a job that offers both a friendly work environment and advancement opportunities. I truly enjoy programming
  and honing my skills in the field, so I am well equipped for a position that rewards commitment and passion. As a testament
  to these qualities, I’ve earned my associate’s degree in Web and Software development from Western Technical College in
  La Crosse, WI and developed experience as a programmer for Cabela’s in Prairie du Chien, WI. I also have many side projects
  that I do on my own including this website. You will find some of those projects linked above. </p>

  </span>
</h4>
<h5>
  <b>Developer 1, Cabelas Inc.</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> Prairie Du Chien, WI - Current</p>
</h5>
<p> Started as a Reporting Specialist I , but after just a few months, my managers recognized my hard work by promoting me to
  Reporting Specialist III and then Developer I. My primary job expectation was to create and edit web pages for all Cabelas
  distribution centers in the United States and Canada. To do so, I use HTML, PHP, CSS, Javascript, Oracle Databases, SQL,
  and Angular, among other specialized web-based tools when necessary. In addition to fully meeting my job expectations,
  my goal is to become a full stack programmer allowing me to work both on the back and front side of web pages. I work in
  a single office with about 10 other people where I develop new websites or manipulate old ones. I have never found it hard
  to get along with the people that I work with.</p>
